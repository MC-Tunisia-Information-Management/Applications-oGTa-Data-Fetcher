# Applications-oGTa-Data-Fetcher
The "Applications-oGTa" function retrieves data from the AIESEC API using GraphQL to fetch all opportunity applications filtered by specific criteria such as committee, program type (oGTa), and date range. It then processes this data into a structured format and writes it to a designated Google Sheets spreadsheet named 'üè¶ applications | oGTa'. For each application, it captures details including person's full name, ID, phone number, managers, backgrounds, creation date, hosting LC, home MC, current status, opportunity title, sub-product name, opportunity ID, duration type, and program short name display, ensuring comprehensive data organization for analysis and tracking purposes.
